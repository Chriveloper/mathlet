## Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

## Configuration

- **astro.config.mjs**: Configuration file for the Astro project.
- **tsconfig.json**: TypeScript configuration file.
- **.vscode/launch.json**: Configuration for running the development server in Visual Studio Code.

## Deployment

The project is set up to deploy to GitHub Pages using a GitHub Actions workflow. The configuration can be found in [`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy.yml ).
